AEC Hackathon, Portland Oregon  July 21-23, 2017

Project:  ParTrack

Purpose:  Track building materials and components using attached QR codes and smart devices to geo-locate items from factory to jobsite, and coordinate related messaging.

The demo landing page is a manager interface, with links to individual part status pages.

Mobile devices can use QR codes to reach a product status page, and desktops can access the same page via link, etc.

Product status pages use WebVR framework: "[A-Frame](https://aframe.io)" to display 3D objects in browsers and smart devices.
