### jQuery Example
***

A demo of DOM manipulation with jQuery.  

The Table of Contents is built after the file has initially loaded by parsing the DOM for <H2> tags and creating anchors and links to each. The Show-Hide feature and Back-To-Top links are handled similarly.

See [jQuery code](./application.js)
