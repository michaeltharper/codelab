# lorify
======

Lorify is a utility to generate inline filler text according to parameters provided by the page designer. It is available in Javascript and PHP, with slight differences in handling of style parameters.  If the script is included in the header, the lorify function can be called inline with two integers - the first for the number of sentences, the second for number of words per sentence.  To simulate titles, if only one sentence is specified, the string is returned in all caps with no final period.
